# About Copymark #
Copymark is a hard drive (and any other storage solution that can be mounted as a drive) performance benchmark designed to simulate real-world drag and drop file transfers. To accomplish this, it generates files and uses the operating system's shell (Explorer in Windows, Finder in OS X) to copy the files.

# Copymark1 #
  * You can find Copymark1 releases at [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/copytest/).
  * Copymark1 is a GUI tool.
  * Copymark1 supports Windows and OS X.
  * Copymark1 is no longer being developed or supported. It has flaws that can lead to inaccurate data.


# Copymark2 #
  * Copymark2 is a from-scratch rewrite of Copymark1 that is designed to be easier to use, more reliable, and more flexible.
  * Copymark2 uses a command line interface. (A GUI is planned)
  * Copymark2 supports Windows, OS X, and Linux.
  * Copymark2 has improvements over Copymark1, such as monitoring disk activity to ensure that a file transfer is complete before beginning a new file transfer.
